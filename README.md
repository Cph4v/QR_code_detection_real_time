# QR-Code Project

This repository is a collection of scripts demonstrating my capabilities in programming and deploying solutions. The project showcases various functionalities related to QR code processing, camera tuning, motion detection, and more. It is intended as a portfolio piece rather than a deployable application.

## Project Structure

- **all_steps_together.py**: Integrates all major steps of the project in one script.
- **camera_tuning_helpers.py**: Contains helper functions for tuning camera settings.
- **client.py**: Client-side script for handling specific tasks related to QR code processing.
- **detect_led_blubs.py**: Script for detecting LED bulbs within an image.
- **function_for_app.py**: Contains various utility functions used across the application.
- **manual_ROI_detection.py**: Script for manually detecting regions of interest (ROIs) in images.
- **motion_detection.py**: Implements motion detection functionality.
- **train_all_together.py**: Script to train models or processes required for the application.

## Features

- **Comprehensive QR Code Processing**: Includes all necessary steps from detection to processing.
- **Camera Tuning**: Tools and functions for adjusting camera settings to optimize QR code detection.
- **Motion Detection**: Implements algorithms to detect movement within a frame.
- **LED Detection**: Identifies and processes images containing LED bulbs.
- **Utility Functions**: A set of helper functions to support various tasks within the project.

## Usage

Since this project is primarily for showcasing my skills, there are no installation or usage instructions. However, you can explore the scripts to understand the implementation details and how they interact.

## Code Examples

### Detecting LED Bulbs

```python
# Example code snippet from detect_led_blubs.py
import cv2

def detect_led(image_path):
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    # Detection logic here
    return detected_leds

# Usage
detected_leds = detect_led('path/to/image.jpg')
print(detected_leds)
